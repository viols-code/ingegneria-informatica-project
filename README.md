# Computer Science and Engineering Project 2022

**Tutor:** Prof. Gianluca Palermo  
**Area:** Architectures of computer systems  
**Keywords:** Drug Discovery, Virtual Screening, HPC  
**Description:**
The project involves the study and implementation of techniques for the manipulation of small molecules or proteins to support the discovery of new drugs using computer tools. In particular, the project sees the development and optimization of techniques known in the literature for the generation of the target pocket from a protein, to support the virtual screening step using HPC (High-Performance Computing) systems

## PASS algorithm
If you want to run PASS algorithm, you can use:  
`python main.py input.pdb output.pdb asp.pdb`    
Where 'input.pdb' is the path of the PDB file containing the protein    
'output.pdb' is the path of the PDB file containing the probe spheres generated by PASS  
'asp.pdb' is the path of the PDB file containing the ASP generated by PASS   

In order to have all the probe spheres founded and so eliminate the last filter, you can use:    
`python main.py input.pdb output.pdb asp.pdb -all`
