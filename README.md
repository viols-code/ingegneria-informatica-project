## PASS algorithm
If you want to run PASS algorithm, you can use:
`python main.py input.pdb output.pdb asp.pdb`  
Where 'input.pdb' is the path of the PDB file containing the protein  
'output.pdb' is the path of the PDB file containing the probe spheres generated by PASS
'asp.pdb' is the path of the PDB file containing the ASP generated by PASS
In order to have all the probe spheres founded and so eliminate the last filter, you can use:
`python main.py input.pdb output.pdb asp.pdb -all`
