# Computer Science and Engineering Project 2022
## Analysis and implementation of methods for the identification of target sites within proteins to support the discovery of new drugs

**Tutor:** Prof. Gianluca Palermo  
**Area:** Architectures of computer systems  
**Keywords:** Drug Discovery, Virtual Screening, HPC  
**Description:**
The project involves the study and implementation of techniques for the manipulation of small molecules or proteins to support the discovery of new drugs using computer tools. In particular, the project sees the development and optimization of techniques known in the literature for the generation of the target pocket from a protein, to support the virtual screening step using HPC (High-Performance Computing) systems

## PASS algorithm
If you want to run PASS algorithm, you can use:  
`python main.py input.pdb output.pdb asp.pdb`    
Where:
- 'input.pdb' is the path of the PDB file containing the protein    
- 'output.pdb' is the path of the PDB file containing the probe spheres generated by PASS  
- 'asp.pdb' is the path of the PDB file containing the ASP generated by PASS   

In order to have all the probe spheres founded and so eliminate the last filter, you can use:    
`python main.py input.pdb output.pdb asp.pdb -all`

## POCASA algorithm  
If you want to run POCASA algorithm, you can use:  
`python main.py grid_dimension input.pdb radius SPF Top_N ranking`  
Where:
- 'grid_dimension' is the dimension of the side of the grid and must have value 0.5 or 1.  
- 'input.pdb' is the path of the PDB file containing the protein  
- 'radius' is the radius of the probe sphere and must have value greater than 1   
- 'SPF' is the SPF parameter and must have value between 1 and 26   
- 'Top_N' is the Top_n parameter and must have value between 0 and 26   
- 'ranking' indicates if you want to sort binding sites groups considering each point as the minumum Manhattan distance between him and the board and must be equal to "yes" or "no"    

## Coverage of the ligand
If you want to run ligand.py, you can use:  
`python ligand.py result.pdb ligand.mol2 radius`  
Where:  
- 'result.pdb' is the path of the result of POCASA or PASS
- 'ligand.mol2' is the path of the ligand
- 'radius' is the radius used for the spheres in the result file
For PASS we suggest a radius of 1.25, for POCASA a radius equals to the dimension of the grid used in the POCASA algorithm
